## RPID to ERPID Transistion

### Remains to be done in the original RPID Grant (From Annual Report)
1. Outreach: Undertake a targeted effort to reach out to repository administrators though communities such as RDA and the AGU coalition to make data FAIR (Arnold Foundation funded), current User Advisory Group members, and other channels to foster adoption of additional evaluations. Adoption has been challenged by the lack of training materials that make evident the benefits of PIDs, a PID testbed, and especially advances such as PID Kernel Information and typed profiles.  This includes a PID Workshop to be hosted by the RPID team during the summer of 2018. The workshop is currently targeted to take place over one and a half days at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana on June 11 and 12. It will target participation from 10 developers who support collections in libraries and other institutions, 6 students from technical disciplines, and the leaders of the RPID Project and the RDA PID Information Types Working Group. 
2. As discussed in the Data Management Plan, a major data product emerging from this project is the workloads that we will produce. These workloads are curated assemblages of persistent IDs (PIDs) drawn from the use cases with which we have worked.
3. Assess use cases against PID Kernel Information guiding principles.  The PID Kernel Information WG of the RDA has produced set of principles for defining PID Kernel Information.  As the RPID use cases evaluated the benefits of PID Kernel Information in the absence of these core principles, select use cases (as they are able and willing) have offered to re-evaluate the benefits of the PID Kernel Information based on the core guiding principles.
4. Evaluate the Collection API for its utility in supporting data provenance as part of PID Kernel Information.  This need is driven by the PRAGMA Rice Genomics use case. Publishable study anticipated as a  result. 
5. Remain responsive to user community needs.
